<b>comparator</b><br>
mind flow:<br>
-use idea from sketches, need to know how to simulate and use capacitor(capacitor-curve)<br>
-think possile to achieve sketches by a schmit-trigger<br>
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger<br>
-dont understand how it works,start to read and experiment<br>
1)bias of transistors(action, state),(transistors folder)<br>
2)treshold of transitors(property, usefull for switch by capacitor)<br>

-understand i do not need trigger but need just a "not"
* https://www.dummies.com/article/technology/electronics/circuitry/electronics-projects-how-to-create-a-transistor-not-gate-circuit-179357/
-assemble some logic (capacitor-switch-with-block)
-understand i cannot use it how it was in my head
-found comparator based on op-amps, built in main folder
