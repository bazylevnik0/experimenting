PaLM additional explanation:
"The circuit is a simple transistor-based relaxation oscillator. When power is applied, the capacitor C1 starts to charge through the resistor R1. When the voltage across C1 reaches the threshold voltage of the transistor Q1, it starts to conduct. This causes the voltage across C1 to drop, which in turn turns off Q1. The capacitor C1 then starts to discharge through the resistor R2, and the cycle repeats. The frequency of the oscillator is determined by the values of R1, R2, and C1. "
